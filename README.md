Got the basics sketched in but does need refining, particularly continuous calculations, dividing by zero, and styling. Also a decimal point button would be nice. All in all very pleased with progress however. - 24/04/2023

Started fresh 26/04 and have had more success this time having advanced beyond my previous attempt and abarring the percentage button functionality and the backspace button, I think it will soon be time to focus on the CSS and styling the calculator to look its best before submitting. - 27/03/2023
